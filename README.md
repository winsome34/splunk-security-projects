# Splunk Security Projects  

This repository contains practical projects and exercises I completed while learning Splunk for Security Operations Center (SOC) analysis.  
The projects simulate real-world scenarios such as brute-force attacks, phishing investigation, user activity tracking, and error monitoring.  

Each project includes:  
- ✅ Problem scenario  
- ✅ SPL query solution  
- ✅ Notes and analysis  
- ✅ Screenshots of Splunk results  
- ✅ PDF project report  

## 📂 Projects Included
1. **Brute-Force Attack Detection** – Identify IPs with repeated failed logins within a short time window.  
2. **Error Monitoring** – Track critical system errors and failures.  
3. **Phishing Email Investigation** – Search and analyze malicious emails and URLs.  
4. **User Activity Tracking** – Monitor login failures and successes for suspicious accounts.

These projects demonstrate practical security monitoring and threat detection skills using Splunk.
